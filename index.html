    <p>Lyrics</p>
    <p> Do you ever feel like a plastic bag <br>
        Drifting through the wind, wanting to start again? <br>
        Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin <br>
        Like a house of cards, one blow from cavin' in? <br>
        Do you ever feel already buried deep? <br>
        Six feet under screams, but no one seems to hear a thing <br>
        Do you know that there's still a chance for you? <br>
        'Cause there's a spark in you <br>
        You just gotta ignite the light <br>
        And let it shine <br>
        Just own the night <br>
        Like the Fourth of July <br>
        'Cause baby, you're a firework <br>
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth <br>
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br> 
        As you shoot across the sky
        Baby, you're a firework
        Come on, let your colors burst
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
        You don't have to feel like a waste of space
        You're original, cannot be replaced
        If you only knew what the future holds
        After a hurricane comes a rainbow
        Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
        So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
        Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow
        And when it's time, you'll know
        You just gotta ignite the light
        And let it shine
        Just own the night
        Like the Fourth of July
        'Cause baby, you're a firework
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        As you shoot across the sky
        Baby, you're a firework
        Come on, let your colors burst
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
        Boom, boom, boom
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
        It's always been inside of you, you, you
        And now it's time to let it through
        'Cause baby, you're a firework
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        As you shoot across the sky
        Baby, you're a firework
        Come on, let your colors burst
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh"
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe
        Boom, boom, boom
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
        Boom, boom, boom
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon</p>
