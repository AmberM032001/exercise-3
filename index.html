    <p>Lyrics</p>
    <p> Do you ever feel like a plastic bag <br>
        Drifting through the wind,<br>
        wanting to start again? <br>
        Do you ever feel, feel <br>
        so paper thin. Like a house of cards,
        one blow from cavin' in? <br>
        Do you ever feel already buried 
        deep? Six feet under screams, <br>
        but no one seems to hear a thing <br>
        Do you know that there's still a <br>
        chance for you? 'Cause there's a <br>
        spark in you. You just gotta ignite the light <br>
        And let it shine <br>
        Just own the night <br>
        Like the Fourth of July <br>
        'Cause baby, you're a firework <br>
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth <br>
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br> 
        As you shoot across the sky <br>
        Baby, you're a firework <br>
        Come on, let your colors burst <br>
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br>
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe <br>
        You don't have to feel like a waste of space <br>
        You're original, cannot be replaced <br>
        If you only knew what the future holds <br>
        After a hurricane comes a rainbow <br>
        Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed <br> 
        So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road <br> 
        Like a lightning bolt, your heart will glow <br> 
        And when it's time, you'll know <br> 
        You just gotta ignite the light <br> 
        And let it shine <br> 
        Just own the night <br> 
        Like the Fourth of July <br> 
        'Cause baby, you're a firework <br> 
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth <br> 
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br> 
        As you shoot across the sky <br> 
        Baby, you're a firework <br> 
        Come on, let your colors burst <br> 
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br> 
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe <br> 
        Boom, boom, boom <br> 
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon <br> 
        It's always been inside of you, you, you <br> 
        And now it's time to let it through <br> 
        'Cause baby, you're a firework <br> 
        Come on, show 'em what you're worth <br> 
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br> 
        As you shoot across the sky <br> 
        Baby, you're a firework <br> 
        Come on, let your colors burst <br>
        Make 'em go, "Oh, oh, oh" <br>
        You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe <br> 
        Boom, boom, boom <br>
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon <br>
        Boom, boom, boom <br> 
        Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon</p> <br>
